**General Analysis**

GUS Identification/GUS-ID: Identifies GUS proteins from input protein fasta file using structural metagenomics approach as described in manuscript (Supplemental Figure 4). 

GUS Identification/GUS Structural Class ID: Identifies structural class of GUS proteins within input protein fasta file using parameters as described in manuscript (Supplemental Figure 1).

Proteomic Abundance-Rate Regression Analysis: Defines regression statistics for rates-abudnance associations within specified protein structural similarity thresholds.

Omics-Taxonomic Rank t-Tests: Defines t-Test statistics for rate Z-scores as a function of relative bacterial abudnance for each taxonomic rank.
