This repository includes all code related to **Gut Microbial Beta-Glucuronidases Influence Endobiotic Homeostasis and Are Modulated by Diverse Therapeutics**, accepted to be published in *Cell Host & Microbe*.


Identify Beta-Glucuronidase (GUS) enzymes from a protein FASTA file with [GUS-ID](https://github.com/redinbolab/GUS_Endobiotics/tree/main/GUS%20Identification/GUS-ID).

Identify the structural class of GUS proteins within a protein FASTA file with [GUS_Loop_ID](https://github.com/redinbolab/GUS_Endobiotics/tree/main/GUS%20Identification/GUS%20Structural%20Class%20ID).

Identify structure-informed rate-abudnance associations with [FitFinder](https://github.com/redinbolab/GUS_Endobiotics/tree/main/Proteomic%20Abduance-Rate%20Regression%20Analysis).

Define statistics for rate-microbial abundance associations at each taxonomic rank with [Omics_ttest](https://github.com/redinbolab/GUS_Endobiotics/tree/main/Omics-Taxonomic%20Rank%20t-Tests).
